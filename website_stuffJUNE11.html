    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Shenzhen, China, Jianing Yang 杨佳宁 (2004) is a Chicago-based composer whose work explores dreams, memory, and ecology. She is drawn to the entanglement between people and fictional worlds—and how these projections shape perception and identity. Her works explores multimedia electronics, surreal textures, and fragmented narratives. She writes for both Western and Chinese instruments in solo, chamber, and large ensemble settings.

        In parallel with her musical practice, Jianing is actively engaged in ecological research through laboratory work and academic conferences. She aims to integrate music and science, exploring composition as a form of interdisciplinary storytelling and science communication.
        
        Jianing has collaborated with leading ensembles such as the Bergamot Quartet, Mivos Quartet, Vacuum Quartet, Ensemble Dal Niente, earspace ensemble, Fonema Consort, Slee Sinfonietta, Newfound Chamber Winds, as well as performers including Yifei Xu and Mary Beth Orr. Her works have premiered at June in Buffalo, reMusik, Chamber Summer Fest, HighScore Festival, 15-Minutes-of-Fame, MATA Jr., ICEBERG, Tidewaters, and DMEW student organized music festivals (2023–2025) in Beijing and Shanghai, where she is an active member.
        
        She has studied composition with and been mentored by Alex Mincek, Ania Vu,  Lee Weisert, Allen Anderson, and Colton Brook. She is currently pursuing a BM in Music Composition and a BA in Environmental Science and Biology at Northwestern University. 
        
        Outside of music, she visits natural history museums and field ecology, likes laufey, and is a fan of LoveLive! and aespa.
